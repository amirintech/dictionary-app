## Project Overview

The Dictionary Web App is a real-world application that integrates with the Dictionary API to provide a dictionary service. Users can search for words, see the dictionary API's response for the searched words, play the audio file for a word when it's available, switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts, switch between light and dark themes, and view the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size. The application is built with React & tailwindCSS.
